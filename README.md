The purpose of this project is to reinforce concepts of class inheritance and other Object-Oriented Programming principles, such as constructors, access rights, and method overriding. The assignment is divided into two parts, where completion of Part I is a prerequisite for Part II.

Part I:

    The project begins with drawing a UML representation of a class hierarchy that includes various transportation classes like WheeledTransportation, Train, Metro, Tram, Monowheel, Ferry, Aircraft, and World War II Airplane. The classes are interconnected based on their relationships.

    Implementation involves writing Java code for the specified classes, organized into six packages. Each class must have three constructors (default, parameterized, and copy), accessors, mutators, toString(), and equals() methods. Objects created with concrete serial numbers require a method called getNextSerialNumber(). Appropriate access rights are to be used.

    A driver program is written to test all classes and methods. It creates at least 16 objects, tests equality, creates two arrays with mixed objects, and calls the findLeastAndMostExpensiveAircraft() method, displaying relevant information.

    A separate document must be submitted to analyze and explain the correctness or misbehavior of the program's output, specifically regarding the findLeastAndMostExpensiveAircraft() method.

Part II:

    A new driver program is created, treating it as a separate assignment, with a static method named copyTheObjects. This method takes an array of objects, creates a copy using copy constructors, and returns the new array.

    Restrictions are set not to explicitly find the object types or use clone() in the copyTheObjects method.

    The driver program creates an array of 15 to 20 objects, including at least one from each class, and calls the copyTheObjects() method to create a copy of the array.

    A separate document must be submitted to analyze and explain the correctness or misbehavior of the program's output, specifically regarding the copying of objects.

Overall, the assignment emphasizes the practical application of OOP concepts, testing, and documentation of the implemented functionality. The separation of Part I and Part II ensures a systematic and focused approach to the assignment's requirements.
